![AWS CodeBuild Status](https://codebuild.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/badges?uuid=eyJlbmNyeXB0ZWREYXRhIjoibk1JcW1LMFdOYXpNL0c5T052VzRCc0l1SE9BR3BzZkh2bkdlNGxyTzNuUzBOZ2tvZmtWZE1ZbWdrQmplSDJYODVOYnlRc1lDRWhrejI1ZS9aS1ZaZG5zPSIsIml2UGFyYW1ldGVyU3BlYyI6IlNCTzVjWmpXMXlrSHdrNmIiLCJtYXRlcmlhbFNldFNlcmlhbCI6MX0%3D&branch=master)

Terraform module that configures an AWS S3 archive target and adds that target to the Rubrik cluster. The following steps are completed by the module:

- Create a new AWS S3 Bucket
- Create a new user specific to Rubrik
- Create a new IAM Policy with the correct permissions and attached to the new user.
- Create a new KMS Key to use for encryption
- (optionally) Adds the S3 Bucket to the Rubrik cluster as an archival location
